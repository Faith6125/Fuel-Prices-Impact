# Fuel-Prices-Analysis
Fuel Price Analysis Project involves analyzing fuel price data for three months (May, June, July 2023) and exploring various aspects of fuel prices.

# Project Structure
- Data Analysis Scripts: July prices
-                        June prices
-                        May prices
-                        Combined data for fuel prices
- Database Schema: fuelpricesproject.db

# Instructions
 Set up a Microsoft SQL Server database.
 Run the database schema SQL script to create the necessary tables.
 Execute the data analysis SQL scripts to perform various analyses on the fuel price data.

## Results
The analysis revealed several interesting trends and correlations in fuel prices.
--The data suggests that there is a weak positive correlaton between the prices of different petroleum products. In that as the price of petrol rose though higher, the price of diesel also went up at a slower rate.
--The price of fuel within the 3 months consistently rose with the least developed towns experiencing higher price fuels compared to highly developed towns.
--The disparity in fuel prices between lower-developed and highly developed towns highlights potential economic disparities and inequalities. Higher fuel prices in less developed areas could place a disproportionate burden on residents, businesses, and industries in those areas, affecting their economic viability and quality of life.
